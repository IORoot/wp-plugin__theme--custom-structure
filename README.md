##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage

This simple plugin allows you to create sub-directories in your theme folder for your theme files.

In your theme root, create `src/views` folder.

You can now add any `page-{slug}.php` files in that folder instead of the root of the theme. This cleans up the root.
